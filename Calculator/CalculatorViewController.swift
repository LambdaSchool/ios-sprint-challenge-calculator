//    n operandTapped, go to the storyboard to see what buttons this action is connected to. Since it is connected to multiple buttons, you'll need to extract the text property from the button. It's likely going to require using the if-let technique to unwrap an optional. You should end up with a String which contains the text displayed on the button. This is the digit you need to add to your transaction.
//    Once you have the digit string, call addOperandDigit on your brain and pass in the digit string. That method returns the string you need to display on the screen, so assign the return value from that method to the text property of the outputLabel.

//    Call the clearTransaction method. OK
