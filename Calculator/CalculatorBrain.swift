//
//
//- In setOperator, convert the operatorString passed into this method into an instance of your OperatorType enum, and then assign it to your operatorType property.
//- In calculateIfPossible, hopefully you can calculate an answer based on the data you've stored so far in the brain.
//   1. Start by checking that the two operand strings are not empty, as "" wouldn't turn into a valid number.
//   2. Then, check that the operatorType variable isn't nil, since you need a valid operator to perform the arithmetic.
//   3. Convert the two operand strings into Doubles.
//   4. With all that setup done, use the type you found in step 2 to decide which kind of arithmetic you'll perform on the operands. Since you have several possible codepaths and only want to execute one of them at runtime, a switch is likely a good choice here. ðŸ˜‰
//   5. For each kind of arithmetic, use your two operand Doubles to perform either addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division (remember you can't divide-by-zero, so make sure to check for that before actually doing the math to avoid the app crashing. If you do encounter that, simply return "Error" for your answer).
//   6. Whatever your result is from the above arithmetic, return the answer as a String.
////   7. If you can't do the calculation because you're missing some piece of data, return nil.
