/* Above the class, look for the enum called `OperatorType`. It will help you decide which type of calculation to perform. One case is already created for you, but you'll need to add the other three: `subtraction`, `multiplication`, and `division`. Notice the raw value type of the enum is `String`, which means each case can have a separate value that is a `String`. Go look at the operator buttons in the storyboard. Notice they use different symbols from `+, -, *, /`. Copy the following symbols from this document for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division: `+, âˆ’, Ã—, Ã·`. Place them after each corresponding case (use the addition case as a model). This mapping of case to symbol will let you determine what operation the user wants to perform from the symbol string on the button. */
